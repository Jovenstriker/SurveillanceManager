# SurveillanceManager
Utilized hand-implemented data structures to design a surveillance manager that can trace back which people were called. Includes runtime analysis, UML diagram, unit-tested code, project proposal (includes why I chose certain data structures, not just all hashmaps), system test plans, and pseudocode algorithm design.
Part of project for North Carolina State's Data Structures and Algorithms Class
